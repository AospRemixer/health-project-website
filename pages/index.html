            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Let me introduce you to Liam. Liam is a 13 years old teen who just started his grade 8 school year. He was very excited, but had no idea what was coming his way. He knew he needed to step up his academic greatness. He worked very hard and many hours a day, it was his dream to become the greatest software developer. He knew a lot about tech, and was known as the tech guy in class. He could solve almost any tech issue in class, and always scores over 90% and up on assignments. There were a few things that blocked his road to success. Liam suffered from bullying. Liam usually studied alone, and didn’t have great social skills. Everyone bullied him in his class, and the bullies will keep on going on. Liam was so distracted from that and couldn’t focus on school. He was very angry when the bullies bullied him. Some people had no mercy on Liam and just said all the rude things that popped up on the top of their head. They embarrassed Liam in front of everyone, and pushed Liam everytime he walked by.  Liam was so done with this so he decided to do something about it. He really wanted to do something about it. He thought for sometime. He had a good and positive attitude, so he thought he should keep ignoring for sometime. That action resulted worse, his anger kept building up. Liam would punch his pillow, listen to motivational music to stay alive. His life had become tortchure. He was very angry at this point. His anger was off the charts. Now his positivity started to disappear. If you were in this situation what would you do?

            <h2 class="section-heading text-title">Scenario 1</h2>
            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Liam decides to beat up the bullies, he knew that they would surely stop after that. Liam brings with him a heavy bag. He runs to the park where the bullies usually hangout after school. He realised that instead of 1 person, there were 5 people. He thought this was gonna be an all in one chance to beat them all up. What he didn’t realise was how he was gonna beat up 5 people by himself. He dashes towards the bullies and spins his bag, trying to get all the force he can and then slams it on the bullies. Two of them fell to the ground while the other two tried to stop Liam. This is when Liam realised that he is screwed, he realised that he is only 1, while the bullies are a group. He sprinted as far as he could, the bullies were a lot faster than Liam. They caught Liam and slammed him towards the ground. Liam cried for help, but the bullies had no mercy and kept beating up Liam. One punched him on the stomach while the other punched him on the arm. They broke Liam's arm bone, they punched him one last time and walked away. Liam ended up getting beat up, instead of taking revenge. It took him a hour or so to get back up on his feet, as he walked home he was trying to think of an excuse to tell his parents. When he got home he had no idea what to say to his parents. His parents questioned him and he had no reply to give. He was very embarrassed by what he had done. The next few weeks in his life were filled with regret thoughts.</p>

            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Liam decides to hold it for more, he tries controlling his anger for many months. He realised that the bullies weren’t getting much work done in class while Liam was getting off the chart marks. Liam was proud of himself, and his anger was starting to go away. He passed grade 8 with flying grades, and got selected for the best high school in his city. He was very proud of himself, and so were his parents. He learned with all his effort, and ignored the bullies. They called him a nerd but he was determined to do something big in life, and he has dedicated many years to it. Liam got a great job in google as a software engineer. While the kids that bullied him didn’t have a good job. Liam got a huge house, a luxury car and lived in california with peace. While the bullies didn’t even have a house yet. Controlling all that anger really did pay off. </p>

            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">If you think scenario 2 is the best option, then you are absolutely correct! There is NO reason to beat someone up, controlling anger always results in the best. Most crime happens in anger because no one wants to commit crime for fun. Controlling anger is a skill, a must have one. If you control your anger at the moment, it will pay off eventually. Usually ignoring is the best option, do what's the best and never fall for things that are in your way of becoming successful.</p>
