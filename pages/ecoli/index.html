              Intentional:

            <p class="text-faded mb-4"><strong>Spinal Cord Injury: </strong> Spinal cord injures are caused by damage to the spinal cord, usually permanent. When the Spinal cord get damage it can cause paralysis. This means that a body part can freeze because the spinal cord cant correctly send signals to the body part.<br>
              <strong>Broken Bones: </strong> Broken bone injuries occur when something harder then the bone itself strucks the bone. This causes the bone to break, usually broken bones can heal but sometimes the damage is too strong and causes the bone to break permanently. Usually when something like this happens the docters will do a surgery to put it back together. When you have a broken bone, you will face pain, and fear of breaking the bone.<br>
              <strong>Concussion: </strong> Concussions are usually mistaken by broken bones, but thats not true. Concussion is when your skull gets damaged, usually by a impact against something stronger then the skull. This causes the skull to be damaged. The brain moves back and forth rapidly because of the damage. Concussions are serious and if you ever think you have one then report it to a docter immediately.<br>
              <strong>Laceration: </strong> Laceration is in simple words, a cut. You can get a laceration from something sharp, something that can cut through your skin layer. A laceration occurs when something sharp cuts through your skin layer. When it goes further then the skin layer, like all the way to the muscle layer. Then docters recomend getting medical help. That type of deep laceration can get dangerous. Besides that, most laceration are only through the skin layer. That type of laceration can be healed by itself, and doesnt require much suppourt.<br>
              <strong>Brain Injury: </strong> Brain injury is when a injury causes the brain to behave different then most other brains. Sometimes people have a brain of a child, but age of a adult. The adult person might behave like a child because his brain isn't behaving properly. Brain injury causes the neuronal activity in the brain to behave different. All this can be caused by one single injury.<br>
              <strong>Death: </strong> Death is a irreversible cessation. There is no typical way to <i>FIX</i> or <i>UNDO</i> death. Its the biological ending of a living species. This is when the dead body starts to decompose. Death can occur by many things. Fortunately death is pretty rare, you wont see many people dying everyday. </p>

            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">For many years, many living species have made safety rules that avoid them from getting killed. There are many reasons why we have rules, and one of them is to not get killed. So tip 1, ALWAYS follow the rules no matter what. Usually the smallest thing can save your life. Sometimes we do things without equipment in laziness, it usually ends up bad because we risk our lives to save a few seconds. Tip 2, ALWAYS wear the proper saftey no matter what. You will avoid many injurys if you stick with the rule and wear the proper equpiment. My last tip will be to ALWAYS be concious. Some people just do what they want to do without being fully councious. This can be very minor, but can cause death very easily. Your one mistake can make you lose your life. PLEASE JUST be concious and aware of whats happening. If you follow all these steps, then your gonna be as safe as a locker ;)</p>
